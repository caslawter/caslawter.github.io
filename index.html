						<p>
							I graduated from SP with a Diploma in Information Technology in 2022.
						</p>

						<p>
							Initially, I wanted to pursue career as a game developer, and so.
							I tried enrolling for the games design and development Diploma in SP as my first choice and
							Diploma
							in IT as my second choice. However, because I had no art background, I was
							given the second choice instead. Although it was a bum at the time, it was actually a
							blessing
							in disguise.
						</p>
						<p>
							During the 3 years in DIT, I found my passion in building software. I enjoyed
							the aspects of tinkering around the different libraries in my project to build something
							unique, fun and
							beneficial for the people using it.
							Not only that, I also found enjoyment teaching my peers about programming and that
							programming and solving
							problems together is a great way to bond with each other.

							I believe that training department is the right choice for me because it aligns with my
							goals of teaching people. I believe that programming is a crucial skill that everyone should
							have.
							However, many people are put off by the intimiditing concepts and syntaxes of programming
							languages and
							thats why teaching them can be hard sometimes.
						</p>
						<p>
							I find the challenge of trying to teach a person fun. Thinking of ways or analogies to dumb
							down a concept
							into digestiable content that can be easily understood. And the best part of organising the
							workshops
							is to see people having gain new knowledge and apply this new found knowedge to their
							projects or
							modules.

							The experience I had with the directors and execs in training department has gave me a really good experience.

							Having grown from teaching workshops to developing a fully working prototype and competing on a national
							level, 

							Not only that, being a director also allows me to learn new technologies
							
							I still remember all our first workshops where we taught our own respectitive 
							contents. Some of us taught Javascript, GenAI, unit testing, backend development and many more. The 
							commitment to learning and accumlisation of the knowledge led them to building a fully working project and even
							competing on the national level, and it brings a tear to my eye on how far they have come and 
							it just makes my passion burn even brighter to lead the next generation of executives should I 
							become the director.

						I worked together with the previous Tech director Terris to build Palpedia. A fun little website
						that
						we built for the MESS workshop.
						Terris handled the frontend
						while I worked on the backend portion of the web.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have also worked on the .HACKathon Noir, a minigame where you find the solve the mystery using
						SQL
						queries.
						This minigame was created together with training exec Cassia and Brian from perplexity for
						helping us deploy the game on the cloud. The game was showcased during the meta camp
						booths and subsequently played during the hackathon. It was really fun watching the people play
						the game made by us and it drives me with motivation to create more minigames for the
						subsequently hackathon.

						If I am elected as tech director, my first priority would be to continue to manage our very own
						.hack website. I understand that there has been quite many iterations of the .hack website
						across different
						batches and that we have recently created a new one. My goal would be to managed the website
						with care as well
						as adding content that stays true to the original vision of the creators of the current website.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not only is my job just maintaining projects, I would also like to initiate new and exciting
						projects to work
						on for the club. Currently, we only have 1 custom minigame made for the hackathon. I promise
						that by the next iteration of the
						hackthon, we will have 3 fun and exciting minigames created for the hackathon. These game will
						be our
						flagship event
						that many people remember our hackathon for.
